# projectscrape
A project to learn scraping with python
```

## Scraped sites (in chronological order)
Because this is a learning project, the sites scraped are incremental in difficulty.
For the first few sites, you will see that the code is very similar because I was learning from [John Watson Rooney's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JohnWatsonRooney). 

1. rei
2. fortytwo 
3. castlery
4. carousell

All these are for educational purposes only. Not for commercial use or to mess with the sites.
