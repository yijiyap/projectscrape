# projectscrape
A project to learn scraping with python

## Scraped sites (in chronological order)
Because this is a learning project, the sites scraped are incremental in difficulty.
For the first few sites, you will see that the code is very similar because I was learning from [John Watson Rooney's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JohnWatsonRooney). 

### 1. rei
some backpacks information!

### 2. fortytwo 
some tables information!

### 3. castlery
some sofas!

### 4. carousell
up to you to search what item you want, including price filters

All these are for educational purposes only. Not for commercial use or to mess with the sites.
